Tic Tac Toe - C++

The intention of this Github is to design a repository for a project intended for learning purposes only. The main objective is to complete a project which contains the following features:

*Player selects a piece, whether it be an 'x' or an 'o' - Capital or lower case should not matter.
*AI opponent selects a piece, opposite of the one the player has selected.
*Player places piece on board in a location of the player's choice
*The board is updated and the game determines a winner based on the rules of traditional Tic-Tac-Toe
*The project only needs to work, modularity and design is a plus however not the critical goal of this project. This project is intended to serve as instructional purposes in the fundamentals of C++
*Documentation is important to understand the functionality of the code
*Output will be the console
